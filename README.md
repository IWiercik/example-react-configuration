# **TOOLS :**
>## ***Absolute imports (jsconfig.json)***
It helps us avoid the hell nests -> ../../../../**God-where-IAM ?!?!!?**
</br>
*Compiler "learn" that our "src" folder work as base folder with imports.*

>## ***ESLint (.eslintrc)***
ESLint help us to get our **code cleaner** and more **protected** from errors.It works depending on created patterns, standards and rules.If something will be wrong in your code eslint will show you error or warning depending on configuration.

>## ***Prettier (.prettierrc)***

In this configuration I used the prettier to transform our code to cleaner. Prettier is using his schematics linked with ESLint rules. This tool will transform the code after the save.
